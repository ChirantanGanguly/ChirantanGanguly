### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am [Chirantan](https://chirantanganguly.github.io/Chirantan-Ganguly/) 


I am currently pursuing my B.Tech Undergraduate in [Electronics and Communication Engineering](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/academic/rpe.html) from the [University of Calcutta](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/). My interests are somewhat in the intersection of Applied Machine Learning, Deep Learning in IoT and smart devices. 

Also, recently I have been enjoying reading about the hardware designing. I am always on the look out for exciting research opportunities, so do drop by if you want to have a discussion!
